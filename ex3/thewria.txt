select() allows a program to monitor multiple file descriptors,
       waiting until one or more of the file descriptors become "ready"
       for some class of I/O operation (e.g., input possible).  A file
       descriptor is considered ready if it is possible to perform a
       corresponding I/O operation (e.g., read(2), or a sufficiently
       small write(2)) without blocking.

   File descriptor sets
       The principal arguments of select() are three "sets" of file
       descriptors (declared with the type fd_set), which allow the
       caller to wait for three classes of events on the specified set
       of file descriptors.  Each of the fd_set arguments may be
       specified as NULL if no file descriptors are to be watched for
       the corresponding class of events.
